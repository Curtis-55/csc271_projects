        <h1>Steak Frites</h1>

        <p>Steak Frites is my favorite dish becuase it is the
            perfect blend of flavors. When cooked perfectly creating a comforting
            yet indulgent meal. A special memory I have had with this dish
            is ordering it at the River Bar in westerly. When it was served
            it had very delicous crispy golden fries and the steak was very tender with 
            lots of flavor as it was cooked in a red wine sauce.
        </p>
