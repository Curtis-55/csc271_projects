#1 In my script for the UpgradeTree there is a lot of code that repeats a self contained 
task. Such as the handiling of choices and clearing the elements.

#2 The sections that could be turned into functions are the clearing elemtents and handiling 
of upgrade choices, Some parameters I could use are list, output, and box.

#3 my first function will clear the content from the html elements before showing 
new information it will have a parameter next step and result but will not return anything. My second function will display the upgrade choices and handle
inputs. Some parameters this function will use are box and output and it will have
no return. These functions will enhance my site by simplifying it improving the readabiliy
and will reduce repition by implementing loops. A new function that could enhance my site could be a show message function
that displays a custom message with paramters like targed and text but no return.
